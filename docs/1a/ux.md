# User Experience

Conceptually, user experience is a broader term than interaction design. We can design the product, but the user experience depends on aspects of the user (and though we can identify and characterise our users, we can't *design* them)

However, in industry UX is sometimes as a narrower term -- a shorthand for roles whose *main concern* is the user experience of the product rather than its technical construction. Whereas the programmers, who also impact the user experience (if their code doesn't work and it breaks, that's not a great experience!) tend to be busy coding and designing the software architecture.

- Breakfast analogy
- Thermomix example (the user experience is not necessarily centred around the UI)
- UX roles in industry can vary along many dimensions, for example:
    - how technical ("just" the UX, versus front end roles)
    - how deep (whether the role is confined to the UI layer of the architecture, or is full-stack)
    - how polished (producing wirefames and mockups, or pixel perfect designs)
    - how established (designing a new product is different from refining an existing product)
    - methodology (depending on the number of users, it might be mostly qualitative or mostly quantitative)
