# User Centred Design

Otherwise called "human-centred design", to avoid labelling your users as if using your app was their defining characteristic. They don't exist to be users of your app -- they are humans looking to get on with their lives, and hoping that your app will help them in some way.

This is the term we're going to spend most of the course on. How do we put users at the centre of our designs? How do we ensure that what we design helps our users and works well with their ways of working?
