# Interaction Design

- Interaction Design is a term that conveys the idea of designing interactive technology. It's still a very broad term, but slightly narrower than HCI. For example, an HCI project might consider how technology *is* used, and stop there. Whereas if we're talking about interaction *design*, that suggests we'd like to think about how we *want* it to be used, and how me might design the technology to encourage that to happen.

- It is also a slightly *overloaded* term -- there's not one universal definition of what constitutes interaction design and what doesn't.

- There are various ways of thinking about what goes into a product. One might be to think about

    - The software design -- how the device works technically
    - The visual design -- what it looks like
    - The interaction design -- how you envisage users working with the app

## User Experience Iceberg

Occasionally, people have a misconception that HCI, or UX, is simply about "the UI". Sometimes, even academics do this. Every now and then, I meet another academic at the university and they ask what my research area is. And as soon as I've mentioned HCI, they've made some remark on "oh, you research buttons" or on making interfaces look nice.

However, design runs much deeper into the application, into how it works not just how it looks. The "User Experience Iceberg" gets represented a number of different ways, but one is that it covers:

- The user interface
- The interaction -- how the user works with the app
- Structure -- how the app is designed and built
- Scope -- what the app is intended to do, and what it's not intended to do
- Strategy -- the goals of the people (or company) producing the app. For example, are they trying to reach into a particular market niche? 

## Thinking about a bicycle

Let's use a physical example to delve into this a little further. Let's consider the differences between a vintage bicycle and a modern racing bike.

- There's an *aesthetic* difference -- the vintage bike conveys a certain aesthetic that some riders might feel corresponds to their self-identity.

- But there's also ergonomic differences -- for example, the handles on a racing bike are a different shape, putting the rider into a more aerodynamic posture (but perhaps also a more dangerous posture in traffic -- it's more effort to look up at the road)

- There are differences of engineering -- the racing bike, being made of modern alloys is likely to be lighter and more rigid

- There are differences of functionality -- the vintage bicycle is much more likely to have a light and mudgards, for legally riding around on wet evenings.

The design of the bicycle isn't simply about its looks, but many different kinds of relationship between the bicycle, its purpose, its structure, its materials, and its rider.
