# Human Factors

- Another research discipline, this emerged from disasters ("signal events") that made people realise that sometimes working systems can fail due to human factors

- *Socio-technical systems* -- a system isn't just technology. For example, air traffic control involves not just radar and aeroplanes, but air traffic controllers, pilots, and how they communicate.

- Tenerife disaster -- two fully working aeroplanes collided at the airport, costing many lives, largely owing to a communication misunderstanding

- Three Mile Island -- a minor incident nearly became a nuclear catastrophe because the nuclear plant operators had a subtle misconception about what an indicator light was indicating.

- Medical mistakes -- communication errors are the largest category of medical error. For example, if a doctor is interrupted when taking a patient history, they might assume a question has been answered that has not been, and miss a key answer that would have indicated the patient may have cardiac issues and should be treated differently.
