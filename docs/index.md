# Preface

I teach user experience and interaction design to students who already have a reasonable background in programming, but limited exposure to design concepts.

This matches my own route into research -- I began my career developing technology in industry, and soon discovered I wanted to design it *differently* and cared quite deeply about technology innovation and using the design of technology as a way to explore different problem spaces (research through design).

In my teaching, I like to set challenges that will prompt students to encounter the problems we want to talk about -- on occasion, I've nicknamed this the "feel the pain" pedagogy. So, when I teach user experience and interaction design, I ask students to use human-centred design approaches to take an app idea from initial pitch, through user research and low-fidelity prototyping, to developing a working prototype of the most important part of the app. That's not too different from most other user experience courses, but it bears mentioning as context.

As students work through their projects, there's a set of videos explaining and introducing various Human-Computer Interaction concepts. But I can be quite visual in my videos, preferring not to talk over bullet points wherever possible. So, this site is intended to evolve into being a set of notes to go alongside my teaching. Please note, though, this is **not intended to be a replacement for watching the videos** -- even when the site is more complete, not everything in a class will necessarily appear in the text here; rather, it's a replacement for having bullet points on the slides.

Experimentally, I'm going to try embeddeding the videos into the pages of the site. That'll take a little while to do, though, as at the moment these pages are broken up into smaller sections than the videos.
