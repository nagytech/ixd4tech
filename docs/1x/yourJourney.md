# Your Design Journey

## Pitch

- A useful skill in itself
- Can be the shortest route to discover "why am I wrong"
- Though we're doing UCD, have an "idea in your back pocket"

## Low Fidelity Prototype

- User research
- Show us your design process
- On-paper wireframe
- One built using a prototyping tool
- Usability testing results
- How you'll change your design

## Working Prototype

- Code it!
- Video it working
- Pitch
- Usability test
- Where would it head next?
