# Designing technology is a wicked problem...

The quickest way to explain what a *wicked problem* is, is to say it's not a *tame problem*. Tame problems are ones you can know you have solved -- for example, if I set you a well-specified task to write a program that could find the first fifty prime numbers, you could write it and write a test to know that it works.

But suppose I were to say that your challenge is to solve poverty...

Wicked Problems were defined by Rittel and Webber in a famous 1973 paper: 

* Horst W. J. Rittel and Melvin M. Webber, 1973. *Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning*, Policy Sciences, 4, pp155-169

They established ten characteristics of Wicked Problems:

1. There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem
2. Wicked problems have no stopping rule
3. Solutions are not true-or-false but good-or-bad
4. There is no intermediate test and no ultimate test of a solution
5. Every solution is a “one-shot” operation
6. Unbounded set of potential solution; no well-described set of permitted operations
7. Every wicked problem is essentially unique, but
8. Every wicked problem can be considered a symptom of another problem
9. The choice of explanation determines the resolution
10. The planner has no right to be wrong

And they observed that most planning and design problems are essentially wicked problems.

The observation we're trying to make in this section is that technology design problems are also generally wicked problems.

### Some things we don't know

- What the problem is
- How to tell when we’ve found what the problem is
- Which explanation of the problem is the right one
- If there is a right one!
- Whether we’ve thought of enough solutions
- How to fully test a solution
- How our customers can tell what’s a feasible solution
- Our customers
- How they work
- How they will work
- What they’re even talking about
- How to describe to a non-technical customer what we’re even talking about
- How long it will take
- How much it will cost
- Whether it’ll be worthwhile
- How much we’ll muck it up along the way

## Envisioned World problem

Another way of characterising this is that we are not trying to design for the working patterns of today, but for the working patterns of that world where people have started using our technology (a world that does not exist yet)
