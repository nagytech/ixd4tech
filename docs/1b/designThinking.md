# Design Thinking

Design thinking is a popular approach that we're going to follow. 

It tries to structure your design process around the following steps:

1. **Empathise** -- Getting to know your users and customers, and ways of understanding their problems from their perspective. This is sometimes called *user research*.

2. **Define** -- Once you have conducted some user research, you will usually have a lot of disordered bits of information. As the design team, you need to delve into it, and try to define and refine what the "true underlying" problem is. 

3. **Ideate** -- Once you have an idea about what the problem is, then you need to come up with some ideas for how to solve it!

4. **Prototype** -- Though the earlier stages will probably have given you a much *better* understanding of your users and the problem, you're probably still wrong in lots of ways. Rather than diving into creating an expensive product, first you should prototype your ideas so that you can...

5. **Test** -- ...test your ideas quickly with your users, and find out if you were right about how they would use them and what they would like. 

Though it's presented in stages, typically design soon becomes iterative. In the test stage you find out yet more about your users (empathising), and that leads you through further cycles of defining what you've discovered, refining your ideas, and testing them.

## Other iterative models

Design thinking has a lot in common with other human-centred design approaches

It's also somewhat similar to Action Research -- an iterative process whereby the people who work in a field themselves engage in reflective cycles of design: *plan, act, observe, reflect* and then plan again...


## Conclusion

The job of the designer is to establish the userâ€™s true underlying needs and design. To do this, you're going to need to become a *reflective practitioner* constantly examining problems, trying to better understand them, designing solutions, putting them in front of your users, and then examining how they interact with them in order to refine your designs.
